Repo for the Developing Data Projects project.

This is a simple application to assist in analyzing a dataset to determine the best features to use for prediction.

I am basing this on the content from the "Practical Machine Learning" course, specifically the lecture on "Covariate Creation".

This project will use the wage data contained in the ISLR package, a future enhancement might be to allow input of the dataset to analyze.
